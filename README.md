Final Project Made by: Alejandro Carmona S and David Restrepo A

Developed on MacOS Sonoma (14.4.1) using Visual Studio Code version 1.88.1 (Universal) with Python 3.11.2. Tools used to complete the assingment: Dexter C. Kozen Automata and Computability.

How to run the code:

open your terminal on your preference IDE

Write "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" depending on wich python version you have installed.

First write c> 0 for the number of grammars you want to create, then you will write a number k>0 for the number of productions of the grammar to be created, then you will write the productions (separated by a blank espace, take into account that this is only the first case - Example: S AS A -); the program should read k lines, the number of lines you entered above (Each line you must press enter to confirm). When you finish the firts grammar, you just repeat the process with each grammar, until you have completed the number c of grammars you wanted to create.

Done! Now the code will tell you the set of FIRST & FOLLOW for each grammar.
